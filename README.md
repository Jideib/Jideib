- ## Harnessing Data for Positive Change: A Multi-Skilled Approach

Welcome! I'm @Jideib, Ibraheem Alawode, a data enthusiast with a diverse skillset focused on using data for good. Currently, I'm on a mission to leverage my data journalism and analysis background for impactful projects in health and environmental sciences. This journey involves honing my data science skills, building upon my existing proficiency in SQL, Python, JavaScript, and C++.

**Bridging the Gap Between Analysis and Action**

While I'm excited about the world of data science, my experience as a business and financial analyst is a valuable asset. I've effectively utilized tools like Power BI, Metabase, Mode BI, and Tableau to extract insights and drive informed decision-making.  

This repository serves as my data science playground, where I'll explore various projects that delve into health and environmental data.  Feel free to join the journey! Collaborations and discussions on data-driven approaches to these critical issues are highly encouraged.

**A Multifaceted Skillset for Maximum Impact**

My skillset goes beyond traditional data analysis. I'm proficient in crafting clear and concise technical documentation, ensuring even complex information is readily understood. Additionally, my intermediate-level front-end web development skills allow me to build interactive visualizations that bridge the gap between data and audiences.

**Beyond the Code: Open Source & Linux Enthusiast**

Beyond technical skills, I'm a strong believer in open-source software and its potential to democratize information and empower communities. This passion extends to my proficiency in using Linux desktops and server environments, allowing me to navigate the technical landscape efficiently.

**My Interests & Continuous Learning**

* Public health data analysis and its potential to improve healthcare delivery 
* Environmental data science and its role in tackling climate change and resource management
* Data storytelling that transcends technical jargon, making complex information accessible to a wider audience

I'm a lifelong learner, constantly seeking to expand my knowledge and skillset. Feedback and collaboration are at the heart of this journey, so don't hesitate to reach out! Let's work together to harness the power of data for positive change.
